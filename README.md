# Middle-atmosphere data processing and visualization

The main goal is to prepare new website visulization of meteor-radar station in Collm solely in python (see [here](https://meteo.physgeo.uni-leipzig.de/de/wetterdaten/radar.php)).

## Roadmap
- [ ] visualization of preprocessed meteor-radar files
  - [ ] wind measurements
  - [ ] tides
  - [ ] daily temperatures derived from the decay of in-dividual underdense meteor trails (Hocking, 1999; Hockinget al., 2001)
- [ ] processing of mdp files 
- [ ] add visualization of other datasets
  - [ ] ICON@DWD (see [here](https://github.com/VACILT/PV_characteristics_ICON-NWP)) up to 80 km
  - [ ] [GFSv16 up to 0.01 hPa](https://twitter.com/SimonLeeWx/status/1374297378891706370)
